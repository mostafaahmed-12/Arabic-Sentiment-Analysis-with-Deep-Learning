# Project Description

## Title: Deep Learning-Based Sentiment Analysis for Arabic Text

### Description:

This project focuses on sentiment analysis for Arabic text using deep learning techniques, specifically employing transformers, recurrent neural networks (RNN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately classify Arabic text into different sentiment classes such as positive, negative, or neutral. The project involves the development of a deep learning model from scratch, utilizing various techniques for preprocessing, regularization, and experimentation.

### Key Components and Techniques Used:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Duplicated reviews are removed from the training data.
   - Textual data is processed by replacing and removing specific characters, handling diacritics, and normalizing the text.
   - Stop words are removed, and stemming is applied.
   - Emojis are handled, and an embedding is created.
   - One-hot encoding is performed for target classes.

2. **Text Tokenization and Encoding:**
   - The Arabic text is tokenized using the Tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 10,000 words.
   - Encoding schemes are applied to represent the text in a format suitable for deep learning models.

3. **Imbalance Handling:**
   - Techniques like resampling are employed to address class imbalance in the dataset.

4. **Model Architecture:**
   - Two main deep learning architectures are explored: LSTM-based, Transformer-based, and a custom CNN model.
   - LSTM-based Model:
      - Embedding layer with 10,000 words and an output dimension of 128.
      - LSTM layer with 128 units.
      - Dense layer with softmax activation for classification and three neurons.
   - Transformer-based Model:
      - Custom transformer block with multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers.
      - Global average pooling for feature extraction.
      - Dense layers for classification.
   - CNN Model:
      - Embedding layer with 10,000 words and an output dimension of 100.
      - LSTM layer with 50 units and dropout of 0.2.
      - Conv1D layer with 100 filters, kernel size of 3, and ReLU activation.
      - GlobalMaxPooling1D layer.
      - Dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout.

5. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - The models are trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
   - Early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting.
   - Validation is performed on a 20% split of the data in each epoch.
   - Learning rate schedules and custom callbacks are used for optimization.

6. **Experimental Approaches:**
   - Different experiments are conducted, including handling class imbalance, resampling data, adjusting hyperparameters, and incorporating regularization techniques.
   - Model performance metrics such as accuracy and categorical cross-entropy loss are monitored and evaluated.

7. **Results and Submission:**
   - The final trained models are applied to the test data for sentiment prediction.
   - Predictions are converted into appropriate sentiment labels and submitted in a CSV file.

8. **Visualization and Analysis:**
   - Learning rate schedules, training loss, and validation loss are visualized for model analysis.
