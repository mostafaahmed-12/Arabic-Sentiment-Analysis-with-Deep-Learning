# Arabic Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis for Arabic text using deep learning techniques, specifically employing transformers, recurrent neural networks (RNN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The goal is to build a robust model that accurately classifies Arabic text into different sentiment classes, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Follow the instructions in the Data Preparation section.
Run the provided scripts for training and evaluation.
Data Preparation
The dataset is preprocessed as follows:

Duplicated reviews are removed from the training data.
Textual data is processed by replacing and removing specific characters, handling diacritics, and normalizing the text.
Stop words are removed, and stemming is applied.
Emojis are handled, and an embedding is created.
One-hot encoding is performed for target classes.
Model Architectures
LSTM Model
Embedding layer with 10,000 words and an output dimension of 128.
LSTM layer with 128 units.
Dense layer with softmax activation for classification and three neurons.
Transformer Model
Custom transformer block with multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers.
Global average pooling for feature extraction.
Dense layers for classification.
CNN Model
Embedding layer with 10,000 words and an output dimension of 100.
LSTM layer with 50 units and dropout of 0.2.
Conv1D layer with 100 filters, kernel size of 3, and ReLU activation.
GlobalMaxPooling1D layer.
Dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout.
Training
The models are trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. Early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting. Validation is performed on a 20% split of the data in each epoch.

Experimental Approaches
Different experiments are conducted, including handling class imbalance, resampling data, adjusting hyperparameters, and incorporating regularization techniques. Model performance metrics such as accuracy and categorical cross-entropy loss are monitored and evaluated.

Results
Experiment Results:

+----------------------+
| Experiment Results |
+----------------------+
| 1. LSTM Model: 80.81% |
| 2. Transformer Model: 82.00% |
| 3. CNN Model: [Accuracy] | # Fill in the actual accuracy for the CNN model
+----------------------+

The final trained models are applied to the test data for sentiment prediction. Predictions are converted into appropriate sentiment labels and submitted in a CSV file.
